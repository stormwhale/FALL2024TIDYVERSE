## Sample Vignette of TidyVerse package: dplyr. Examples of the functions Mutate(), Select(), Filter(), and Summarise() 


To create this sample vignette I will use a csv file found on Kaggle at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayushmishra1512/faang-complete-stock-data?select=Google.csv. The Kaggle webpage contains five csv files, one for each of the FAANG companies, but for this project I will focus on only the Google CSV. The data contains stock movement and volume information for each day from IPO day to 09/04/2020.   



```{r}
#Loading the Data
google_data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chung-Brandon/FALL2024TIDYVERSE/refs/heads/main/Google.csv")
```

## Mutate()
```{r}
# The mutate() function adds a new variable that is a function of existing variables.

#Example 1

google_data <- google_data %>%
  mutate(day_change = (((Close - Open) / Open) * 100))

# Here we created a new variable called "day_change" by using Google's stock price on the open and the close. 
```

```{r}
head(google_data)
```
```{r}
#Example 2

google_data <- google_data %>%
  mutate(day_pchange.5 = abs(day_change) >5)
```
```{r}
head(google_data)
```

## Select() 
```{r}
# The select() function picks variables based on their names.

#Example 

google_data.select <- google_data %>%
  select(Date, Volume:day_pchange.5)

# Here we decided we only wanted to look at the variables Date, Volume, day_change, and day_pchange.5, so we used select to limit the data based on variables. Select returns all rows for the specified columns
```
```{r}
head(google_data.select)
```

## Filter()

```{r}
#The filter() function picks cases based on their values.

#Example

google_data.filter <- google_data %>%
  filter(day_pchange.5 == "TRUE")

# Here we decided we only wanted to look at the rows (cases) where the day_pchange.5 was "TRUE", so we used filter to limit the data based on the value day_pchange.5 being TRUE. Filter returns all columns for the specified cases.
```

```{r}
head(google_data.filter)
```


## Summarise ()
```{r}
#The summarise() function reduces multiple values down to a single summary.

#Example

google_data %>%
  group_by(day_pchange.5) %>%
  summarise(avg_volume = mean(Volume),
            count = n())

# Here we wanted to summarize our data by pulling out statistics of count and average volume. I first grouped the data by day_pchange.5 values (TRUE or FALSE), then the summarise function pulls the statistics for each group. Using group_by then summarise makes for easy statistic comparisons.
```

### Conclusion: The TidyVerse's Dplyr package is great at solving data manipulation challenages and for running statistical comparisons between groups of variable values.
